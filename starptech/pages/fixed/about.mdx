Hi,
my name is Dustin and I’m Fullstack Software Engineer from Germany. I'm specialized in creating reliable and beautiful web applications. This implies the whole journey.
I create web applications in frameworks like Next.js, Gatsby, Angular. The backend is preferably implemented in Node.js, C# or Golang. Cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud are used to provide the required infrastructure.
If I may express my way of working in only one sentence: 

<Text blockquote>Enjoy simplicity, Review decisions and be surrounded by the right people.</Text>

In my free time, I love to collaborate with the Opensource-Community. I’m also maintainer of several opensource projects. Check out my <Link icon color aria-label="github" href="https://github.com/starptech">Github Profile</Link>.


What fullstack really means to me:

- Choose the correct repo strategy (single or mono).
- Setup a CI/CD pipeline (Github CI, Jenkins).
- Deploy with zero downtime.
- Scale and rollback at any time.
- Infrastructure changes and builds are reproducible (Terraform).
- Use the best communications tools (Hangout, Slack).
- Choose the best language and framework for the job.
- Use a process framework like Scrum/Kanban.

What software quality really means to me:

- Write unit, integration and performance tests.
- Have CI/CD on your fingertips.
- Test your app in real world conditions aka E2E tests.
- Establish Coding Standards.
- Follow best-practices of the community.
