# Dustin Deus - Fullstack developer

### My personal blog

My name is dustin deus and I'm 26 years old software engineer from Wuppertal, Germany.
I have an extensive experience in software development in consideration of high quality standards.
In the last years, I developed many SPA's in AngularJs, VueJs and API's in .NET Core,
Node.js and Go. Furthermore, I was responsible to design and implement new prototypes.
Today, I'm Software Architect and help the company to work according
latest standard and best practices. In my free time I love to collaborate with the
Opensource-Community.
