Hemera is a small wrapper around the NATS driver. NATS is a simple, fast and reliable solution for the internal communication of a distributed system. It chooses simplicity and reliability over guaranteed delivery. We want to provide a toolkit to develop micro services in an easy and powerful way. We use bloom filters to provide a pattern matching RPC style. You don't have to worry about the transport. NATS is powerful.

With Hemera you have the best of both worlds. Efficient pattern matching to have the most flexibility in defining your RPC's. It doesn't matter where your server or client lives. You can add the same add as many as you want on different hosts to ensure maximal availability. Thanks to the Request Reply pattern you can work with that as if you do a normal http request. The only dependency you have is a single binary of 7MB. Mind your own business NATS do the rest for you:
