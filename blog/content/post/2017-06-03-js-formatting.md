Formatting in Javascript must not be pain.
You don't have to use any linting configurations files. **No** ~~.eslintrc~~, ~~.jshintrc~~, or ~~.jscsrc~~ files to manage. Beside linting it also warns you about programmer errors early e.g unused variables, unhandled errors and more. Give StandardJs a try!

> It's like [gofmt](https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/) but for Javascript.

## Installation

~~~javascript
npm install standard --save-dev
