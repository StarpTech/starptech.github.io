# Hi there!

My name is Dustin and I’m fullstack software engineer from Germany. I have an extensive experience in software development in consideration of high quality standards.

To me, fullstack really means: 

- Choose the correct repo strategy (single or mono).
- Setup a CI/DI pipeline.
- Deploy with zero downtime.
- Scale and rollback at any time.
- Infrastructure changes and builds are reproducible.
- Programming language and application frameworks are choosen based on team-knowledge and project requirements.
- Use the best communications tools e.g Hangout, Slack.
- Use a process framework like Scrum.

To me, quality really means:

- Write unit, integration and performance tests. 
- Test your app in real world conditions aka E2E tests.
- Establish Coding Standards.
- Follow best-practices of the community.

**Build, Measure, learn your entire life!**

In the last years, I developed many web applications in different javascript frameworks from [Angular 1](https://angularjs.org/) to [Angular 5](https://angular.io/) or [React](https://reactjs.org/). Today, I’m working at [dynabase](https://dynabase.de/). We are helping our industrial customers to efficiently archieve their digital production targets and visions.

In my free time, I love to collaborate with the Opensource-Community. I'm also maintainer of several opensource projects. Check out my [Github Profile](https://github.com/StarpTech).
