# Hi there!

My name is Dustin and I’m fullstack software engineer from Germany. I have an extensive experience in software development in consideration of high quality standards.

To me, fullstack really means: 

- Did you choose the correct repo strategy (single or mono) ?
- Is the CI/DI pipeline maintainable ?
- Deployment with zero downtime ?
- Can we scale at any time ?
- Do we need a package registry (NPM, Docker) ?
- What service architecture is needed REST, GraphQl ?
- Is our infrastructure, build reproducible ?
- ...

To me quality really means:

- Writing unit, integration and performance tests ! 
- Testing your app in real world conditions aka E2E tests !
- Establish Coding Standards !
- Build, Measure, learn !

In the last years, I developed many web applications in different javascript frameworks from [Angular 1](https://angularjs.org/) to [Angular 5](https://angular.io/) or [React](https://reactjs.org/). Today, I’m working at [dynabase](https://dynabase.de/). We are helping our industrial customers to efficiently achieve their digital production targets and visions.

In my free time, I love to collaborate with the Opensource-Community. I'm also maintainer of several opensource projects. Check out my [Github Profile](https://github.com/StarpTech).
