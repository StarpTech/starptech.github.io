      <description>aither Aither shows an approach how to bootstrap a microservice system with Hemera and docker. You can scale your worker in seconds and because we use NATS as “nervous system&amp;rdquo; for our distributed system we do not have to carry about service-discovery or load-balancing of hemera-services. We use traefik to load-balancing the api-gateway.
This configuration will setup:
 Hapi http server which act as api-gataway to the Hemera services. Microservice example which is responsible to add two numbers.</description>

      <description>Hemera is a small wrapper around the NATS driver. NATS is a simple, fast and reliable solution for the internal communication of a distributed system. It chooses simplicity and reliability over guaranteed delivery. We want to provide a toolkit to develop micro services in an easy and powerful way. We use bloom filters to provide a pattern matching RPC style. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about the transport. NATS is powerful.</description>
